https://id-dev-2000.github.io/Meme-Generator/

- receives photos from the imgflip API
- displays photos as options for the user to select
- allows user to input text after selecting image
- displays text over image (as a canvas element)
- allows user to save image as new meme with selected image as background, input text displayed over top

API source: https://imgflip.com/api

Unfortunately, from a retrospective view, I consider the execution to be crude and incomplete.
Improvements may be made in the future.
